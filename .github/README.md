## Developing With npm, postCSS, Rollup, SASS and BrowserSync

This theme uses [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) and [postCSS](https://postcss.org) to handle compiling all of the styles into one style sheet. The theme also includes [rollup.js](https://www.rollupjs.org/) to handle javascript compilation and minification. These choices are based on the same libraries and npm commands used in Bootstrap. In addition, it comes with [Browser Sync](http://browsersync.io) to handle live reloading while you develop.

### Confused by All the CSS, SCSS, and SASS Files?

Some basics about the files that come with Understrap:

- The theme itself uses the `/style.css` file only to identify the theme inside of WordPress. The file is not loaded by the theme and does not include any styles.
- The `/css/theme.css` and its minified little brother `/css/theme.min.css` file(s) provides all styles. It is composed of different SCSS sets and one variable file, all imported at `/src/sass/theme.scss`
- Your design goes into: `/src/sass/theme`.
  - Override Bootstrap by addind your variables to the `/src/sass/theme/_theme_variables.scss`
  - Add your custom styles to the `/src/sass/theme/_theme.scss` file
  - Or add other .scss files into it and `@import` it into `/src/sass/theme/_theme.scss`.

The same goes for Javascript. Just add your javascript to `/src/js/custom-javascript.js` and let rollup.js handle the rest.

### Installing Dependencies

- Make sure you have installed Node.js and Browser-Sync (optional) on your computer globally
- Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your Understrap copy
- Run: `$ npm install`

### Running

To work with and compile your Sass and Javascript files on the fly start:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/build/browser-sync.config.js` in the beginning of the file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
	proxy: "localhost/", // Change here
	notify: false,
	files: ["./css/*.min.css", "./js/*.min.js", "./**/*.php"],
};
```

then run:

```bash
npm run watch-bs
```

## Bootstrap 4 Legacy Build Process

Some of our build tasks have been duplicated to support both Bootstrap 4 and Boostrap 5 asset generation. The _default_ version of tasks will generate v5 assets.

**CSS Tasks** `npm run css` will generate v5 assets, while `npm run css-bs4` will generate necessary assets for v4.

**JS Tasks** `npm run js` will generate v5 assets, while `npm run js-bs4` will generate necessary assets for v4.

**Watch Tasks** `npm run watch` and `npm run watch-bs` will only generate for v5. Once complete, run `npm run dist` to update v4.

**Dist Task** `npm run dist` will generate both v4 & v5 assets.

**Other Assets** This theme also includes a few additional files directories to support Bootstrap 4 in `/src/build-bootstrap4/`, `/src/sass/assets/bootstrap4/`, and `/src/js/bootstrap4.js`

Thank you for choosing Tabeeb! We hope our platform helps you on your medical education journey. Happy learning! ðŸš€
